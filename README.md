# Installation

Usage of this mod requires a full retail copy of Halo CE for PC

WinlatorXR can be installed from its [SideQuestVR page](https://sidequestvr.com/app/37320/winlatorxr) or its [GitHub page](https://github.com/lvonasek/WinlatorXR)

Tutorial videos for installation coming soon!

# Option 1: HWXR Setup EXE

This is the recommended way to install HWXR and is designed to run directly inside WinlatorXR (once you have installed **Wine Mono Installer** from the **System Tools** menu), extract the installer to your **Downloads** folder on your Quest

Install Halo CE Retail edition inside of your container, then run HWXR_Setup.exe

# Option 2: HWXR "Release Only" ZIP

This ZIP file can be extracted over top of a working Halo CE Retail install with the 1.0.10 patch for PC (not Custom Edition), I recommend using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) directly inside your container to do this, or installing Halo CE Retail to your **Downloads** folder and extracting the ZIP over that

In addition to the **Wine Mono Installer** in the **System Tools** menu required for Option 1, do these steps:

* **Copy these DLLs** from a Windows PC to C:/Windows/System32 and C:/Windows/SysWow64 directories in your container:
*  ---> vcruntime140.dll
*  ---> msvcp140.dll
*  ---> webservices.dll
*  ---> ws2_32.dll
*  ---> ws2help.dll
* **Install** the [Visual C++ All-In-One Installer](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist) on your container
* **Install** the [OpenAL Installer](https://www.openal.org/downloads/) on your container

# Final step: Shortcut configuration and running
* Right-click and **Create Shortcut** to your Halo.exe file if it doesn't already exist
* Exit the container and go to the **Shortcuts** section of WinlatorXR
* Edit the shortcut to a **Custom** resolution of **1400x1400**
* Run the Halo EXE shortcut directly from this screen

# WinlatorXR Controls:

* Left Stick - Move / UI arrows
* Right Stick - Turn left/right
* Right Stick Up - Switch Weapon
